Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to help you with how to run this Python code in your IDE:

1. Install Python
Download and install Python from python.org. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.


3. Install an IDE
You can use any Python-friendly IDE. A popular one is Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Download it from Google.
Alternatively, you can use PyCharm.


5. Set Up Your IDE
Open your IDE and create a new project or workspace.
Create a new Python file (e.g., finance_app.py) and copy-paste the provided code into this file.


7. Install Required Libraries
The code uses built-in Python libraries like sqlite3 and hashlib, so you don’t need to install any external libraries. These libraries come pre-installed with Python and if they are not pre-installed, just install them from Google.

To verify your setup:

Open a terminal in your IDE and run the command:
python --version
If this shows a version number, you're all set.


5. How the Code Works
The code is a Personal Finance Management App using SQLite as its database.
When you run the program, it will automatically create a SQLite database named finance.db and the necessary tables (users, transactions, budgets).
Users can register, log in, add transactions, set budgets, generate financial reports, and more.


7. Running the Code
To run the code in your IDE:
Open the terminal in VS Code or PyCharm.

Run the following command:
python finance_app.py
The app will start, and you'll be prompted with options like registering or logging in.


9. Basic App Usage
Registration: Create an account with a username and password.
Login: After registering, log in to manage your transactions and budgets.
Transactions: You can add, update, or delete transactions.
Reports: Generate monthly or yearly reports on income and expenses.
Budgeting: Set a spending limit for specific categories like "Food" or "Rent."


11. Database Location
The SQLite database (finance.db) will be created in the same folder as your Python file. You can inspect this file using any SQLite viewer if needed.


13. Optional: Backup and Restore
You can backup your database to a file (backup.sql) and restore it later if needed.
Now, the code should be ready to run!
